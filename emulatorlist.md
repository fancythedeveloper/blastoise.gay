Here's a probably way too comprehensive list of the emulators I personally recommend for most popular systems, mostly from experience 
(Also all of these are assuming you actually have a decent computer, if you got a spoiled potato some of these might not run well for you)

---

# Nintendo Home Consoles


## NES - Mesen (https://www.mesen.ca/)

Technically a multi-system emulator, but it's probably the best one for the NES, not sure how well it does the other systems. 
Has about all that you'd expect from an emulator, also with texture pack support and a basic netplay system. 
If you're not a fan of it, there's some good alternatives, like puNES, though honestly, any modern emulator should be good enough for what most people want. 

## SNES - ares/bsnes (https://ares-emu.net/)

Putting these both together as these are pretty similar, with ares being multi-system (as the heir to higan) and bsnes being more focused on the SNES, 
with the former being updated more in general compared to the latter. (Mostly will be taking about ares past this.) 
Has a ton of features, including some more-or-less exclusive to it, like Run Ahead. 

## N64 - simple64/ares(?) (https://simple64.github.io/)

While this has been the one I've generally used before, if you care accuracy it might be better checking ares. 
Regardless, still your best bet outside of ares, and is also a lot more out-of-the-box compared to most other emulators for this console. 
Has generally what you'd expect, and also has a dedicated netplay system (a.k.a you don't need to portforward to use it). 

## GameCube/Wii - Dolphin (https://dolphin-emu.org/)

Grouping these together since they share the same answer... do I even need to say what it is? 
Easily one of the most mature out of the ones listed here, the only thing I could really say is PLEASE use the latest releases, do not bother with 5.0. 
Also has arguably the best netplay system listed here, and combined with Wii VC and the integrated mGBA, 
it might be worth using it over other solutions to play with other people. 

## Wii U - Cemu (https://cemu.info/)

Pretty much the only real solution for Wii U, but it is good. 
Has what you'd expect, plus built-in online support (requires a dumped Wii U NAND), and amiibo support. 
Also has texture packs in the form of Graphics packs, which also support mods and cheats. 

## Switch - Ryujinx/Suyu

Unfortunately, it's been harder to find it ever since the shutdown, 
but if you want a version of it that's still getting updated, check out ryujinx-mirror.

If you're looking for an Android solution, it seems like you're gonna have to go to Suyu for that.

# Sega Home Consoles


# Master System - Genesis Plus GX/Snepulator/ares/BlastEm(?) (https://snepulator.net/main.html)

I'm honestly not too familiar when it comes to SMS/GG, mostly have been a Kega Fusion user when it comes to them, 
but you should probably not be using that in the BIG 2024. 
Also worth mentioning that GPGX is only on PC as a libretro core, so unfortunately you can't get it standalone. 
Ares might be your best bet for that then, or BlastEm, but I'm not sure honestly. 

# Genesis/Mega Drive - BlastEm/Genesis Plus GX (https://www.retrodev.com/blastem/nightlies/)

Sorta similar story to the Master System, except BlastEm is definitely worth using, don't bother with 0.6.2 though, use the nightly.
Genesis Plus GX is also good too,
